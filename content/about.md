Hi!
I'm Robert Greener, a PhD student at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
I use agent-based modelling to try to see how we can get people to be more active in their daily commutes.

I have a background in computer science, in particular artificial intelligence.
I also have a master's degree in medical statistics.

Outside of my PhD, I'm a keen open-source software developer.
I mainly use Scala, Rust, and R (for stats) these days.
However, I also use C++, Go, Python, Julia, TypeScript, and some other languages where needed / when I fancy trying something new.
I use Arch Linux across a range of systems and have a keen interest in security also.

Given my wide range of interests this site will contain a number of posts of various different things, all the way from posts on software development and security, to posts on statistics, and *maybe* even posts on sustainable transport.

## Projects

Most of my code these days is hosted on sourcehut, either [git](https://git.sr.ht/~ragreener1) or [mercurial](https://hg.sr.ht/~ragreener1).
I'm in the process of moving most of it to mercurial (against the trend -- I know!).

Under most active development are [beliefspread](https://hg.sr.ht/~ragreener1/beliefspread) and [concept](https://hg.sr.ht/~ragreener1/concept).
These are a library and simulator (which uses the library), respectively.
They allow the simulation of how beliefs spread and interact to cause behaviour to arise in the context of a multi-agent system.
They are both licensed under the BSD-3-clause license.
They are both developed in Scala 3.
beliefspread is available on maven central.
