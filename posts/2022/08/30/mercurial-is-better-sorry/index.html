Despite Betamax having superior video and audio quality1, VHS tapes won the battle.\nFollowing this, throughout the mid 00s and 10s, there was a format war between two distributed version control systems: git and mercurial (hg)2. Git has very clearly won this battle, commanding the entire space. This is despite git being, frankly, a bit shit.\nSo, for some history, around the time git was created the main version control systems were centralised ones such as CVS and SVN. These required a central server. Linux was being developed using BitKeeper a proprietary system that decided to prevent free usage by the Linux project. So, Linus Torvalds created git as a response to this. The same incident also caused the creation of our protagonist: mercurial.\nSubversion (SVN), which was the open-source version control system primarily used before git was incredibly simple. You made changes to files, committed them, and that was it. You’d update your working copy, make more changes, and commit. So on and so forth.\nGit and mercurial are designed to support a distributed model3 where people can email patches to each other and so on. This is great and this is a really useful feature. It makes it easier for untrusted people to contribute and allows a range of working styles.\nSo then, what is the problem with git? It’s UI is totally fucking awful. It’s totally unintuitive. To get some changes on to the central server, you first have to “stage” your changes to some staging area, then commit. Why not just commit? It makes no sense. For ages to delete a remote branch you had to do git push origin :branch. It’s so unintuitive. Then there’s commands like git rerere4 – wtf!? Why can’t it nicely order commits with numbers, e.g., checkout the 5th commit, instead of using SHA-1 checksums to identify them.\nMercurial on the other hand has a much more intuitive UI. Make some changes hg commit then hg push. No concept of a staging area. Ordered, numbered commits. Want to revert local changes to a file hg revert (in git git checkout ).\nThat’s without considering the amazing work done to mercurial recently. In particular the evolve extension is just great. It’s a way of having draft / public commits, where public commits are immutable. For draft commits we can make changes, drop them, reorder them, all while sharing them with others in a safe way. This just isn’t possible in git.\nMercurial also supposedly works better with windows, but I could care less.\nI’m intending from now on to use mercurial (with hosting on sourcehut) as it’s just better. In the long-run, I’d quite like to use pijul a distributed version control system based upon a theory of patches – a modern-day DARCS. However, right now it’s too early.
