Stop doing this. Just stop. If you’re not yet convinced (and I don’t blame you!), let me show you why these are a waste of your time.\nWhy do we care about normality? We should care about normality. It’s an important assumption that underpins a wide variety of statistical procedures. We should always be sure of our assumptions and make efforts to check that they are correct. However, normality tests are not the way for us to do this.\nHowever, in large samples (n \u003e 30) which most of our work as data scientists is based upon the Central Limit Theorem usually applies and we need not worry about the normality of our data. But in cases where it does not apply let’s consider how we can check for normality in a range of different samples.\nNormality testing in small samples First let us consider a small sample. Say n=10. Let’s look at the histogram for this data.\nHistogram of x (n=10). (Image by author) Is this normally distributed? Doesn’t really look like it — does it? Hopefully you’re with me and accept that this isn’t normally distributed. Now let’s perform the Shapiro-Wilk test on this data.\nOh. p=0.53. No evidence to suggest that x is not normally distributed. Hmm. What do you conclude then. Well, of course, not being evidence that x is not normally distributed does not mean that x is normally distributed. What’s actually happening is that in small samples the tests are underpowered to detect deviations from normality.\nNormal Q-Q plot of x (n=10). (Image by author) The best way to assess normality is through the use of a quantile-quantile plot — Q-Q plot for short. If the data is normally distributed we would expect to see a straight line. This data shows some deviation from normality, the line is not very straight. There appears to be some issues in the tail. Admittedly, without more data it is hard to say.\nWith this data, I would have concerns about assuming normality as there appears to be some deviation in the Q-Q plot and in the histogram. But, if we had just relied on our normality test, we wouldn’t have picked this up. This is because the test is underpowered in small samples.\nNormality testing in large samples Now let’s take a look at normality testing in a large sample (n=5000). Let’s take a look at a histogram.\nHistogram of x (n=5000). (Image by author) I hope you’d all agree that this looks to be normally distributed. Okay, so what does the Shapiro-Wilk test say. Bazinga! p=0.001. There’s very strong evidence that x is not normally distributed. Oh dear. Well, let’s take a quick look at our Q-Q plot. Just to double check.\nNormal Q-Q plot of x (n=5000). (Image by author) Wow. This looks to be normally distributed. In fact, there shouldn’t be any doubt that this is normally distributed. But, the Shapiro-Wilk test says it isn’t.\nWhat’s going on here? Well the Shapiro-Wilk test (and other normality tests) are designed to test for theoretical normality (i.e. the perfect bell curve). In small samples these tests are underpowered to detect quite major deviations from normality which can be easily detected through graphical methods. In larger samples these tests will detect even extremely minor deviations from theoretical normality that are not of practical concern.\nConclusion Hopefully, I have shown you that normality tests are not of practical utility for data scientists. Don’t use them. Forget about them. At best, they are useless; at worst, they are misleading. If you want to assess the normality of some data, use Q-Q plots and histograms. They’ll give you a much clearer picture about the normality of your data.\n","wordCount":"639","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-08-04T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2020-08-04T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Robert Greener"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://r0bert.dev/posts/2020/08/04/stop-testing-for-normality/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Robert Greener","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://r0bert.dev/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://r0bert.dev accesskey=h title="Robert Greener (Alt + H)">Robert Greener</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://r0bert.dev/archives/ title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://r0bert.dev/presentations/ title=Presentations><span>Presentations</span></a></li><li><a href=https://hg.sr.ht/~ragreener1 title=hg><span>hg</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li><li><a href=https://r0bert.dev/about/ title="Robert Greener"><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Stop testing for normality</h1><div class=post-description>Normality tests are misleading and a waste of your time</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2020-08-04 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>August 4, 2020</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;Robert Greener</div></header><div class=post-content><p>I see a lot of data scientists using tests such as the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test>Shapiro-Wilk</a> test and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test>Kolmogorov–Smirnov</a> to test for normality.
